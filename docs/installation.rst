Installation
============


Please note that since Python>=3.5 is required, all the below commands, especially `pip`,
also have to be the Python 3 version. This might require that you run `pip3` instead.


With pip
--------

To install OpenKiwi as a package, simply run::

   pip install openkiwi

You can now::

   import kiwi

inside your project or run in the command line::

   kiwi


As local package
----------------

This project uses a newer configuration format defined by PEP-518, namely, a `pyproject.toml` file.
In order to support it, we use `Poetry <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry>`_ as the build system
and the dependency manager.

Since we want to allow OpenKiwi to be used both as an application and as a library,
this has the added benefit of allowing us to specify dependencies in a single location
and simplifying the packaging process. 
Consequently, you'll notice there's no `requirements.txt` and no `setup.py` files.
The alternative routes are explained below.


Before installing OpenKiwi and its development dependencies, we recommend the usual practice of 
creating a separate virtual environment to work on OpenKiwi.

If you don't have Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7, or need help creating a virtualenv, check online guides
like `this <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`_.

**Note**: There's currently an issue with poetry not detecting conda virtual environments. As such
we suggest using virtualenv.

Install Poetry via the recommended way::

   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

It's also possible to use pip::

   pip install poetry

Then, after cloning this repository and once *inside* your virtualenv, instead of the traditional
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, just run::

   poetry install

to install all dependencies.

That's it! Now, running::

   python kiwi -h

or::
   
   kiwi -h

should show you a help message.

MLflow integration
------------------ 

**Optionally**, if you'd like to take advantage of our `MLflow <https://mlflow.org/>`_ integration, simply install it in the same virtualenv as OpenKiwi::

   pip install mlflow


**Or** in case you have installed OpenKiwi as a local package, you should add mlflow to your env with::
   
   poetry install -e mlflow
