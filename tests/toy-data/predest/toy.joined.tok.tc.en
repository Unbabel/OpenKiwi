Lynn is the International Chairman of Youth With A Mission , part of a small group providing influential leadership to the movement .
he has a special passion for communication because he recognizes how central it is to relationships , mission and organizational health .
communication is the primary means we have for connecting with others , for creating and maintaining relationships .
we have at our disposal complex forms of language ( which includes both spoken and written ) , as well as the language of gestures , facial and other physical expressions , non @-@ verbal vocal sounds , and as our choices in clothes , cars , art , furnishings and many other things that reflect our unique personalities and communicate who we are .
it is helpful to view communication as THE tool for building relationships .
