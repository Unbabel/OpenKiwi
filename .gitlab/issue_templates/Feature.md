### Why?
Very briefly, why would anyone use this?
> Eg. Adding this flag would allow us to run experiments to reproduce experiments in `X`.
 
### Description
Describe the problem, specify what would be the benefits
 
> The flag added into the `.yaml` file should automatically modify the behaviour of `X` to perform the task `Y`.
 
### Scenarios
Use as many stories as necessary to define how this would work in different scenario variations, how people would use this and how this could affect the system.  
Something like: When _, I want to _, So I can _
 
> Eg. 

> When using the flag `hidden-state-size-X Y`this should automatically modify the dimension of `X` from the default value of `Z` to the specified value Y
 
### Plan
Convey your plan to tackle this. Tell people how this could be achieved.
> Eg. 

> The modification should be done in files `a.py` and `b.py`. I will test it with `file.yaml`.
 
### Links / references
Always back up your proposals, try to include links, references, etc.
> Eg. This strategy gave some gains in F1-score in paper X.arxiv.com.
